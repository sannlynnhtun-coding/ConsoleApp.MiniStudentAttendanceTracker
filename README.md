# ConsoleApp.MiniStudentAttendanceTracker

### Summary
This application structure adheres to SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class has one responsibility.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Classes are open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Interfaces ensure derived classes can be substituted for their base class.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Smaller, more specific interfaces are used.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

We can now build and run the application to track student attendance in a maintainable and scalable way.
